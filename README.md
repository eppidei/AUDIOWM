# AUDIOWM
Audio Watermarking Project on Simulink

This project is an example of data watermarking into audio files.
The data are low bit rate characters that are embedded below noise floor, in selectable bandwidths that can implement
frequency hopping to encrease security.

The project can be run as GUI based with a main configuration file that is automatically loaded.

There is also a script that is able to run simulink in batch mode with different parameters (bit rate, error correction ratios....) in order 
to evaluate the performaces based on different configurations
